                  <p>I obtained the bird represented in this plate opposite Cincinnati, in the State of Kentucky, in the year 1820, whilst in the company of Mr. ROBERT BEST, then Curator of the Western Museum. It was on the ground, amongst tall grass, and exhibited the usual habits of its tribe. Perceiving it to be different from any which I had seen, I immediately shot it, and the same day made an accurate drawing of it.</p><p>In naming it after the Rev. Professor HENSLOW of Cambridge, a gentleman so well known to the scientific world, my object has been to manifest my gratitude for the many kind attentions which he has shewn towards me.</p><div class="deck">“Perceiving it to be different from any which I’d seen, I immediately shot it.”</div><p>This species is abundant in the State of New Jersey, and breeds there; but of this I was not aware until after my last journey to England, in the spring of 1838, when my friend Dr. JAMES TRUDEAU sent me a specimen procured by himself while in company with our mutual friend EDWARD HARRIS, Esq. This specimen is the finest I have seen, although Dr. BACHMAN and myself have procured a great number in South Carolina, where this species abounds in the latter part of autumn, and where some remain during winter. I have found it in great numbers in all the pine barrens of the Floridas, in winter, but mostly in sandy or light soil, in woods thinly overgrown by tall pines. I never saw this species alight on trees, but on the ground, where it spends its time; it runs with rapidity, passing through the grass with the swiftness of a mouse. In the State of New Jersey it is found in ploughed fields, and I have no doubt was previously overlooked or supposed to be the Yellow-winged Bunting, to which it bears some resemblance. It has not been observed farther to the eastward than the State just mentioned. Its plumage in spring is more richly coloured than in autumn or winter.</p><p>Winters in Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida. Breeds from Maryland to New York. Abundant. Accidental in Ohio.</p><p>Bill short, robust, conical, acute; upper mandible straight in the dorsal outline, angular, and encroaching a little on the forehead, broader than the lower, acute and inflected on the edges; lower mandible also inflected at the edges; the gap-line deflected at the base. Head rather large, neck short, body full. Feet of ordinary length; tarsus scutellate before, acute behind; toes free, scutellate above; claws slightly arched, compressed, acute, that of the hind toe elongated.</p><p>Plumage compact, slightly glossed. Wings short, curved, the third and fourth quills longest, the secondaries nearly as long as the primaries, when the wing is closed. Tail short, graduated and deeply notched, of twelve rather narrow very acute feathers.</p><p>Bill flesh-colour, darker above. Iris dark-brown. Feet flesh-colour. The general colour of the upper parts is pale brown, the central part of the feathers brownish-black the margins of those of the back bright red. Secondary coverts yellowish-red on the outer webs. Quills dark brown, externally margined with light yellowish-brown. Tail-feathers dusky, margined externally with yellowish-brown. The under parts pale yellowish-grey, the breast, sides, and throat, spotted with brownish-black. This species is characterized by its erect, feeble stem, its linear-lanceolate leaves, lax fastigiate panicle, twin pedicels, oboval segments of the corolla, pubescent curved tube, and long subulate calycine teeth. The corolla is rose-coloured, but varies in tint, being sometimes nearly white, and sometimes deep red. It is perennial, flowers in the summer months, and occurs in the Middle and Atlantic States.</p>
