Acadia National Park,ACAD,Northeast,0.435294118,High turnover,-68.24411,44.350732,Northeast,76.6 sq. mi.,nps.gov/acad,https://www.nps.gov/acad/index.htm,Full Birds and Climate Change Report for this park [PDF],http://www.audubon.org/sites/default/files/Full_Birds_and_Climate_Change_Report_for_this_park.pdf,"Maine’s Acadia National Park straddles eastern-deciduous and northern-boreal forests, attracting breeding songbirds, including nearly two-dozen warbler species, in summer. By 2050, a warming climate will likely oust many boreal songbirds, including Bay-breasted Warblers, Blackburnian Warblers, and Boreal Chickadees, into cooler forests north of the park’s borders. At the same time, Acadia’s wetlands, lakes, and coastline are poised to grow more crowded as waterbirds like the Northern Shoveler and Pied-billed Grebe skip their southbound migrations and winter in Maine instead. And Maine’s beloved Common Loon will probably stop breeding in Acadia and limit its wintertime visits. It is recommended that managers maintain wetlands and continue to track breeding warblers."

By 2050, hotter, drier conditions may trigger declines in grassland birds that breed there in summer, such as Upland Sandpiper, Horned Lark, and Burrowing Owl, and the Mountain Bluebird may be extirpated from the park. Meanwhile, species more adapted to the arid Great Plains, including the Mississippi Kite, Northern Bobwhite, and Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, and the Southwest, like Scaled Quail, Cassin’s Kingbird, and Chihuahuan Raven, will likely thrive within its borders. Preserving healthy grasslands will give all birds the best chance possible. "
