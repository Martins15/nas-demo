The work needed to accomplish this goal will also protect coastal communities against the threat of sea-level rise due to a changing climate.  By focusing on the biggest threats to 16 flagship bird species and the places they depend on, we will maximize our conservation impact and help build resilient coastlines. Those 16 flagship species represent at least 375 others as well as the ecosystems upon which they depend.",
