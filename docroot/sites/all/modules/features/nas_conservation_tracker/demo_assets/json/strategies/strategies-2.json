These parcels of forests, ranches, and farms add up to roughly a billion acres--or about half the land in the entire Lower 48 states.  Audubon collaborates with landowners, land managers, government agencies, and private industry across the hemisphere to increase the quality of habitat on privately managed lands to benefit 20 flagship bird species.",
